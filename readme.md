# beavergangster

a dumb computer opponent to play beaver gang against. you do need someone else to input stuff to the bot otherwise it's not fun

this was a project to try to learn D, and likely does not follow best practices.

## building

`dub && ./beavergangster`

## manual

if beavergangster asks for something but it did not happen: just press enter.

filling something - anything in will affirm. (very good cood yes)

the bot might actually get its cards wrong but that's fine.
